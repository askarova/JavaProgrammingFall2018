		//Important things about using variables in Java
		//--> type/datatype, name, value
		
		// Java is a strongly typed language:
		//it means before using any variable, we need to declare first
		//When you declare, we need to put type and name.
		//int steps;
		//int steps will not let to declare same variables twice
		//double steps//not allowed
		//variables names- sometimes can be called as Identifiers
		//double price;
		//System.out.println(price);not initialized compile error
		//Initialize - means assigning value for the first time.
		
		//double price = 12.40;
		// variable naming rules:
		// 1)can be any length - no limit
		// 2) can contain letters, numbers
		// 3) can not start with numbers. int 1stDAy will not work
		// 4) no reserved words
		// 5) meaningful names are prefered. and start with lowercase, then next word
		// start with upper case. we call the style camelCase
